To be totally honest I wasn't even going to respond but I found a screenshot of the last time you've pulled this shit and I cannot believe I still trusted you after the first time. I cannot count how many times you've told me you're some innocent bystander only to go ahead and tell someone what I've said behind my back. You did it with Allicia with the tents and you've done it with Anya countless times. I felt like I could trust you and vent to you to get something off my chest but you took everything I said literally and used it as ammo to fuel this shit. I never should have trusted you again after the first time and especially after I explained how Jamie did the exact same shit and you still went ahead and did it. Every single time you told someone something I said in confidence, you made it infinitely worse. I just cannot understand it at all man. I'm so fucking disappointed in you.
